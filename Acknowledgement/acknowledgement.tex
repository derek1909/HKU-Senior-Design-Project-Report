I would like to thank Dr Artemiy Margaritov and Dr George Wang from HUAWEI UK R\&D for giving me this chance to learn branch prediction and apply the knowledge immediately in this interesting project; the discussions with Artemiy were very 
thought-provoking and fruitful. I also appreciate the effort from Prof Hayden K.H. So for his constructive advice.
