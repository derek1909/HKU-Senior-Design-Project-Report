Branch prediction is a critical part of modern CPU design and is relied upon by many advanced CPU technologies, such as OoO and prefetching. However, the prediction accuracy of branch predictors has rarely been investigated for Warehouse-house Computer â€“ an increasingly deployed and demanded load type. Thus, this project aims to provide an starting points for study branch predictor on warehouse-scale computers. Newly released Google Workload Traces are converted into BT9 format and simulated using CBP-5 kit, followed by comparing SOTA predictors and various loads. Superiority of TAGE has once again been confirmed on WSC traces. Interesting features of WSC are concluded and suggestions for optimizing the branch predictor on WSC are given.
